Create a New Project To begin you will first need to create a new Forge modding environment. This tutorial is targetting Minecraft 1.15, so you'll want to download the corresponding Forge MDK . You'll want to do all the regular tasks such as loading the gradle project into your IDE, setting up version control, filling in mods.toml and build.gradle , and making sure your game loads. Adding the Dependencies The next step is to add the Vehicle Mod into your modding environment. In order for you to add the Vehicle Mod though you will need to also add it's parent library Obfuscate. In order to do this we'll be using the CurseMaven plugin by Wyn-Price. This plugin makes it easy to depend on CurseForge hosted mods. In your build.gradle you'll need to add the following into your build script, then simply apply the plugin. buildscript { repositories { maven { url \"https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/\" } } dependencies { classpath \"com.wynprice.cursemaven:CurseMaven:2.1.4\" } } apply plugin: \"com.wynprice.cursemaven\" Next in your dependencies it's simply a matter of adding the Obfuscate library and the Vehicle Mod. You'll want to use fg.deobf otherwise it won't work in a modding environment. dependencies { compile fg.deobf('curse.maven:obfuscate:2946425') // 0.44.0 compile fg.deobf('curse.maven:mrcrayfishs-vehicle-mod:2963019') // 0.4.3 } In your mods.toml you'll need to tell Forge that your mod depends on these mods to be present and loaded before yours. [[dependencies.your_mod_id]] modId=\"obfuscate\" mandatory=true versionRange=\"[0.4.3,)\" ordering=\"AFTER\" side=\"BOTH\" [[dependencies.your_mod_id]] modId=\"vehicle\" mandatory=true versionRange=\"[0.44.0,)\" ordering=\"AFTER\" side=\"BOTH\" Now simply refresh gradle and the mods will be deobfuscated and added to the project. You should load up your game once and check the mod list to ensure they have been added. If you run into any problems where the files can't be found, make sure you are using at least Forge 1.15.2-31.2.0 and CurseMaven 2.1.4 You're Ready Congratulations, you're now ready to start creating a Vehicle Mod addon! You can now move onto creating your first vehicle . Before continuing, consider making your addon open source. Eventually a list of addons will be formed and allowing other developers read your code helps them develop their own addon.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#notice","text":"This tutorial assumes you have experience creating mods for Minecraft 1.15; This includes writing mods entirely in Java, setting up the Forge MDK, adding new items/entites, etc. You won't be able to add vehicles using tools like MCreator.","title":"Notice"},{"location":"getting-started/#create-a-new-project","text":"To begin you will first need to create a new Forge modding environment.
